#### Video Club Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights on Movie Rentals and Popularity**

---

#### Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Data Science diploma program. It analyzes movie rental data from a video club, integrating information stored in both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. The goal is to identify popular actors, rental patterns, and uncover underutilized high-rated films by combining structured rental records with IMDb ratings and reviews.
